# stockalerts

A python app that uses BeautifulSoup, Email and Push notifications to keep you up to date on your stocks.

NOTE: Due to Google Finance changing their stock dashboard, the regex in one of the scripts is now broken. Currently working on trying to resolve this using BeautifulSoup to scrape the Nasdaq site for prices.
